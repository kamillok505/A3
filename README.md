Unsupervised Learning Techniques README
This repository provides implementations and explanations of five popular unsupervised learning techniques. These techniques are commonly used in various fields, including data analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the inherent structure and patterns within unlabeled data.

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible. It identifies the principal components, which are orthogonal axes capturing the most significant variations in the data.

2. t-distributed Neighbor Stochastic Embedding (t-SNE)
Overview
t-distributed Neighbor Stochastic Embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that visualizes high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. It focuses on preserving pairwise similarities between data points, making it particularly useful for clustering and visualization

3. k-means
Overview
k-means is a clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on similarity. It assigns data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest, aiming to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.

4. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)
Overview
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) is a hierarchical clustering technique that builds a tree of clusters. It starts with individual data points and successively merges them based on their pairwise similarity until all points belong to a single cluster or a specified number of clusters is reached.

5. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
Overview
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are artificial neural networks that perform unsupervised learning. They map high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional grid of neurons, preserving the topological relationships between data points. SOMs are often used for clustering and visualization.
Conclusion
These unsupervised learning techniques offer diverse approaches to understanding and analyzing unlabeled data. Depending on the nature of the data and the problem at hand, one technique may be more suitable than others. Feel free to explore and experiment with these methods to gain insights into the underlying patterns within your datasets.
